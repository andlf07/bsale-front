## **Bsale-test-frontend**

This frontend was developed with Vanilla Javascript, withouth libraries.
You can download and deploy it.

In the file `config.js` is the endpoints we will use to get de data.
I use the the API developed for the test following the README.md from the backend API, to get de data. [BackendAPI](https://github.com/andlf07/bsale-test).

    Add some responsive viewport at 667px and 780px.
    Add burger menu when is at 667px

In `app.js` decide to handle the addEventListeners.
At `src/` is all of the `files` js and `css` I try to made components every one have their own section with .`js` and .`css`
At `libs/` all of `js` where I managed the data and calls de components
At `css/` all the basics of the `css`

Frontend is not my strength but I do my best.
